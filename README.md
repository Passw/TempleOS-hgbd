# hgbd
Host-Guest Block Device for TempleOS

NOTE: This is an older project and hasn't been updated for some time. I am providing it here due to recent requests.

(This can cause some issues with FileMgr if it tries to read a RedSea FS from the block device.)

Makes use of shared memory buffer between TempleOS Guest and Host.

![HGBD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obecebo/hgbd/master/example.gif "Host-Guest Block Device") 

# Features
- Copy files between Host-Guest
- Copy-paste clipboard between Host-Guest
- Download files to Guest via HTTP/HTTPS
- Take screenshot from Guest to Host as 4-bit PNG

You can create custom modules for HGBD and include them in `modules` section of the config
file `/etc/hgbdd.conf`

Start HGBD daemon on Host:

```
    /usr/sbin/hgbdd
```

In `/etc/hgbdd.conf`, replace `blk_dev` with the RAM disk block device (not tmpfs) and
`user` with your username (for shared file write ownership)

To create the block device (64 MiB or larger):

Debian/Ubuntu: `/dev/ram0` builtin  
macOS: `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://131072`  
Windows: Use [ImDisk](http://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/#ImDisk) or a similar utility 
 
On your TempleOS VM, connect `COM2` to `TCP4:127.0.0.1:7202` (default) and create a raw
device mapping to the block device. 

Examples: 

QEMU: Add `-hdX /dev/ram0` to startup parameters  
VirtualBox: `VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename "ram0.vmdk" -rawdisk /dev/ram0`  
VMware: `Edit VM > Settings > Use a physical disk`

Define `unit`, `base0`, `base1` and drive letter for `HGBD_DEV` in `HGBD.HC` (default is `I:`)

`#include "HGBD"` in your `::/Home/HomeKeyPlugIns.HC` to make use of shortcut keys for
copy-paste and screenshots.
